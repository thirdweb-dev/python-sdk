```

## Calling the modules

You can call the NFTLabs modules by instantiating an SDK object and fetching the module with your contract address
like this:

```python
import os
from nftlabs import NftlabsSdk, SdkOptions

sdk = NftlabsSdk(SdkOptions(), "https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com") # polygon testnet as an example

# Assumes your private key is assigned to the `PKEY` environment variable
sdk.set_private_key(os.getenv("PKEY"))

# Put your NFT contract address here if you want to mint your own NFTs!
nft_module = sdk.get_nft_module("0xbDfF8fb43688fB4D2184DF8029A7238ac1413A24")
print(nft_module.total_supply())
```

## Development

### Generating ABI wrappers

The `abi` package contains autogenerated code compiled by the
0xchain `abi-gen` tool found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0x/abi-gen).

Our protocols are developer at [this repo](https://github.com/nftlabs/nftlabs-protocols).

Install the `abi-gen` cli tool and use it to compile abi wrappers like this:

```bash
$ # assumes you have the nftlabs-protocols repo cloned in the parent directory
$ abi-gen --language Python -o thirdweb/abi --abis ../nftlabs-protocols/abi/NFT.json
```

Anytime there are ABI contract changes, you should regenerate the abi wrappers.


### Writing Documentation

This package uses [`PyDoctor`](https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor) to auto-generate docs. Each method, class and variable should have a detailed description of what it is meant for as a comment enclosed in triple quoation marks (`""" """`) just below the line they are defined.

Example:

Do:
```python
def my_method(self, arg1, arg2):
    """
    This part goes into the documentation.
    """
    return arg1 + arg2
```

Don't:
```python
"""
This part will not go into the documentation.
"""

def my_method(self, arg1, arg2):
    return arg1 + arg2
```


Addtionally, each module should also have a docstring at the top of the file. This will be used as a breif descroption of the module on the [homepage of the documentation](https://python-docs.thirdweb.com/). 

Example:
```python
1 """Interact with the NFT module of the app""" # docstring
2 # Module code starts from here
3 # ...
```
